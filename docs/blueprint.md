# **App Name**: NFT Reward Hub

## Core Features:

- Token Deployment: Deploy a fungible token on either Binance Smart Chain (Solidity) or Solana (Rust) with a defined name, symbol, supply, and allocation strategy.
- Reward Contract: Develop a staking smart contract that distributes the deployed fungible token as rewards.
- Dashboard Display: Provide a clear, intuitive interface for users to view their token balances and staking rewards.
- Stake Submission: Design a simple mechanism for users to stake their tokens.
- Reward Visualization: Visualize the time-based reward accrual through a progress indicator or similar UI element.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#3F72AF) for trustworthiness, growth and environmental awareness, drawing a thematic connection to 'Nori Farm'. (In HSL space, a hue of 214 degrees implies a shade of green.  Desaturating this slightly, and reducing brightness somewhat, creates the described hue.)
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8) to provide a clean, neutral backdrop that complements the primary color and allows the UI elements to stand out (In HSL space, 214 hue and desaturation around 15% makes for a light grey).
- Accent color: Soft orange (#F4A261) for key actions and highlights, creating a warm and inviting user experience while maintaining sufficient contrast with the background and primary colors.  (Orange is approximately 30 degrees "left" of green in HSL.)
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headings and short chunks of text, 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text
- Use clear and consistent icons related to tokens, staking, and rewards.  Consider a minimalist style to enhance readability and match a modern design aesthetic. To avoid relying on visual cliches, choose icons with abstract shapes.
- Implement a clean and intuitive layout with a focus on usability and accessibility. Ensure that key information and actions are easily accessible to users.
- Add subtle animations to provide visual feedback to user interactions (e.g., button presses, reward updates).
